### ðŸ”„ How to update existing tokens

#### Figma design tokens are automatically synced with this [github repository](https://github.com/M-Castellarnau/DesignTokens/tree/master).

1. Create a new branch
2. Copy updated `tokens.json` file and replace existing one in this project
3. Run `pnpm build` - that will trigger the script to split tokens into light and dark themes and generate `index.css` with updated variables
4. Verify output and update storybook components if needed
5. Update tests/screenshots if needed
6. Commit your changes if you are fine with them
7. Read the general rules on how to create changesets in [publishing settings](/README.md#Publishing)

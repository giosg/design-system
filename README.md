# Giosg Design System

## ðŸŽ“Philosophy
We build the design system following next principles:
 - **Modularity**. You don't have to use it all at once. Each piece is consumable individually.
 - **Low maintenance - high value**. We don't include irrelevant or specific functionality. We don't cater to every use case. We test only what we have control over.
 - **Incremental adoption**. You don't have to discard the old to use the new. They can coexist
 - **Inversion of control**. As a consumer, you have complete control over all the "meat" of the components in the design system. All low-level functionality is available.
 - **Tree-shakable**. Our components are designed to be tree-shakable.
 - **Open design**. Our components are building blocks. You can combine them in countless ways to create higher-level components. You are the architect of the final product.

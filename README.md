# Giosg Design System

![](./assets/giosg-color.svg)

## 🎓 Philosophy

We build the design system following the next principles:

- **Modularity**. You don't have to use it all at once. Each piece is consumable individually.
- **Low maintenance - high value**. We don't include irrelevant or specific functionality. We don't cater to every use case. We test only what we have control over.
- **Incremental adoption**. You don't have to discard the old to use the new. They can coexist
- **Inversion of control**. As a consumer, you have complete control over all the "meat" of the components in the design system. All low-level functionality is available.
- **Tree-shakable**. Our components are designed to be tree-shakable.
- **Open design**. Our components are building blocks. You can combine them in countless ways to create higher-level components. You are the architect of the final product.
- **Accessibility**. Components adhere to the WAI-ARIA design patterns where possible.
- **Low dependency**. We aim to minimize external and cross-package dependencies to the lowest possible value.

## 🧦 What belongs and what doesn't

Design systems should only contain pure and presentational components. These components deal with how UI appears, respond exclusively to props, do not contain app-specific business logic, and are agnostic to how data loads. These properties are essential in allowing the component to be reusable.

Design systems aren’t the superset of every component library in an organization. That would be a headache to keep track of.

App-specific components that contain business logic should not be included because that hamstrings reuse by requiring consumer projects to have identical business constraints.

Omit one-offs that aren’t currently being reused. Even if you hope they become part of the design system one day, nimble teams avoid maintaining excess code when possible.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

For the majority of components the tech stack is [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/) backed up by plain css.

### Why radix-ui ?

Radix is one of the industry-leading open-source libraries providing unstyled primitives. It's better to read the Radix [documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction) to get familiar with what it offers. Radix fits perfectly with the philosophy for the design system. It's a well-tested and well-maintained library written by outstanding people with a focus on accessibility.

Most of the Radix components boil down to pure React and have no dependencies.

### Why pure CSS ?

There are multiple reasons to support this approach. I'll provide you with the most of them

- **No framework dependency**. Crucial for ease of maintenance and adoption, you don't have to specify peer dependencies in your project, match versions, or undergo migration to new versions. You also don't have to discard your current solution, as CSS is just CSS.
- **No runtime overhead**. Compared to other solutions like CSS-in-JS, plain CSS incurs zero runtime overhead and avoids DOM manipulations, resulting in faster operations than CSS-in-JS. Less JS - faster operation. You can check one of the articles about this [here](https://pustelto.com/blog/css-vs-css-in-js-perf/)
- **Long-term caching**. CSS is very easy to get long-term cached by the browser.

## 🏛️ Project structure

Project is a monorepo run by [turborepo](https://turbo.build/). Shortly we have a structure that look like that:

```
└── apps/
    ├── storybook/
    ├── tree-shaker/
└── packages
    ├── @eslint-config/
    ├── @stylelint-config/
    ├── foundation/
    └── button/
├── package.json
├── README.md
```

The main folders here are app and packages. Packages are consumable distributables which can be publishable or private. There is a naming convention that packages prefixed with @ are private and for local usage only. For example `@eslint-config`. For non-private packages which will be npm-publishable the convention is to name them without @ prefix like `button`.
The apps in apps/ folder are there to consume packages from packages/ folder.

## 📐 Testing

For testing solutions, ![](./assets/playwright.svg) [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used. As a rule of thumb, we should test only what we have control over and trust all the third-party providers that they test their own code. Therefore, the testing part of the project will mostly involve screenshot testing.

Playwright is very flexible in that sense, as it is able to perform various operations, and screenshot testing is just a minor part of its functionality.

Playwright uses [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) library under the hood for performing screenshot comparison.

The main benefit of using Playwright is its ability to consistently test across three main browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) in Docker environments.

After every CI run, Playwright screenshots and test results are sent to the PR comments. This feature comes in handy when you've added a new test and need a screenshot reference or want to update a screenshot reference for the failed test. It's particularly useful for ARM-based Mac users, as there is a minor pixel difference between screenshots taken by these systems and Linux (even when running in Docker). Therefore, we consider screenshots captured by CI as the source of truth.

By default, Playwright does not update failed screenshots. To get a new reference, you have two options: you can remove failed screenshots and rerun the CI, this way playwright will create a new screenshot, or you can find the "actual" screenshot of the failed test from the "test-results" folder and then replace your current screenshot with it.

Once you've ensured there are no unintended changes, commit the new screenshot, push the changes to Github, and CI should not detect any differences.

## 🔨 Local development

Recommended way to start local development is by using [Volta.js](https://volta.sh/) for managing your nodejs and package manager versions.

- after `volta.js` installation we have to install `pnpm` package manager by

```
volta install pnpm
```

- install node version pinned in package.json

```
volta install node <version>
```

- install all the dependencies

```
pnpm i
```

- since some of our packages dependant on the pre-built versions of another packages we need to make a full-package list by running

```
pnpm build-packages
```

Now when the installation is ready its time to quickly get familiar with the basics of [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) and how the tasks run in `turbo.json`.

You have a traditional set of command for the repo like `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`. They will run corresponding command in the packages and apps.

## 📦 Packages

The main unit of the design system is consumable packages which are stored in `packages` directory.

### Add a new package

I think the best way to start a new package is to copy an existing package which is in your opinion is a closer fit to the package you want to add. At the current stage the best simple standard package is `packages/switch` .

- Copying the existing package.
- Remove all git-ignored folders, as well as `CHANGELOG.md` so in the end you will end up with something like that:
  ![](/assets/copied-packages.png)
- Check the corresponding configs like `eslint, stylelint, tsconfig`. They should be just fine and point to the global configuration.
- We need to make changes to `package.json`. Namely, change the package name, description. Reset version to 0. And remove unnecessary package.
  ![](/assets/package-changes.png)
- Now you can go and change the source files in `/src` .
- Make a first build of this package by running `build` command for the package.
- Import this package to the storybook app.
- From now on continue develop as normal.
- When you are finished with the development choose a major version for this package when you will do `changeset` for the packages. Read more about that in Publishing instructions.

### Updating an existing package

The flow for updating a package is pretty simple.

- Make changes to source files
- Run `changeset` and following the semantic versioning pick a proper version.

## 🎁 Versioning / Publishing

Packages follow [semantic versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/).

Publishing is done through the package named [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Browse documentation to know the details.

But in short if you want to publish a new version of the package you have to use `pnpm changeset` command to add your changeset in which you describe all of the changes you made. You can accommodate multiple changesets of multiple packages. When you are done with your changes run `pnpm version-packages` under which `changesets` automatically bumps all of the packages and dependencies to the proper versions.

Next step - create a pull request with your changes. Check that pull-request reviewer is assigned. This should be done automatically because project has code-owners. When pull request is merged and everything is fine (linting, tests and so on) new versions of packages are deployed ⚠️ **automatically** ⚠️ be aware and cautious of that.

### ⚠️ Info about versioning Foundation package.

Here are some "underwater stones" when you version changes the foundation package. Since the foundation package is a `peerDependency` in most of the packages all non major changes to that package should not bump dependant packages to **major** versions. This is the quirk of `changeset` library.
Here is the issue on github https://github.com/changesets/changesets/issues/380 where you can find more info.
So if you update foundation package and run changeset over it you will have to manually decline changes to the dependant packages if they reference foundation package by `"@giosg-design-system/{package-name}": "workspace:^"` (and they should), or make appropriate manual changes to them if it they are not ` "workspace:^"`.
